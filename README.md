## Introduction üó®Ô∏è

"Breakout" is a classic arcade video game that was created by Atari, Inc. and released in 1976. It was designed by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, with input from Steve Wozniak, who would later co-found Apple Inc. The game is often considered one of the pioneering titles in the video game industry and played a significant role in popularizing arcade gaming during the 1970s

## Rules üìú

1. Objective: Clear all the bricks using the paddle and ball, while preventing the ball from falling past the paddle.
2. Controls: Use the paddle to bounce the ball. Move the paddle left and right.
3. Lives: You have limited lives. Losing a ball reduces a life. When lives run out, the game ends.
4. Winning: Clear all bricks to progress.
5. Losing: Lose if you run out of lives.
