## 🧠 Story

This breakout game was originally a university assignment from my first year, based on [Stanford’s CS106J project](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/18-Assignment3.pdf). At that time, everything in CS was new to me, and even simple programs felt overwhelming.

The original version used Stanford’s graphics library and had a persistent bug — the ball would sometimes get stuck in the paddle. Despite taking every possible deadline extension, I never fully fixed it. Later, I found that the fix was already buried in the library’s documentation. 😅

Years later, while learning TypeScript and Pixi.js, I decided to rebuild the project from scratch. This rewrite helped me understand TypeScript, game loops, rendering, and other core web development concepts much more deeply. 🚀
