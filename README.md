## Background 🤯

The breakout game was one of my university projects during my first year. At the time, everything in computer science was new to me, and even writing simple programs was a challenge. This project, based on the original assignment (available [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/18-Assignment3.pdf)), was a significant hurdle.  

I used Stanford's library to implement most of the functionality, but there was one persistent bug where the ball would occasionally get stuck in the paddle. 🏓 Despite taking all possible deadline extensions, I couldn’t completely resolve the issue. Later, I discovered that this issue had already been addressed in the conditions provided by Stanford's library. 😅  

Years later, while learning TypeScript and exploring libraries like Pixi.js, I decided to revisit and rewrite the breakout game. This time, I approached it as a way to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and modern development tools. I also applied new techniques to minimize the ball-and-paddle bug, though a few small issues still remain—making it a fun, nostalgic learning experience. 🚀  


## Setup 🌱

The setup is as simple as it gets!

1. If you haven't already, download and install Node.js and npm from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you cloned the Sorting Visualizer repository.
3. Open a terminal and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. After that, simply run `npm run dev` for a local development environment.

P.S Game is not responsive 😅 I don't recomend it for phone users 🤯
